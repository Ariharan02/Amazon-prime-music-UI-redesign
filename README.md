# Amazon-prime-music-redesign
Revamping UI with entirely new features

I started our research by understanding more about the Amazon Prime Music service, finding out about its competitors and potential audience. It's the fastest-growing music streaming service with 70% growth last year. What makes it unique is Alexa integration, due to which it has a different target audience as compared to competitors who targets a younger demographic.

Along with the younger audience, about 14% of subscribers to Amazon Music are aged 55 or older, compared with just 5% of competitors' customers.

This project is to analyse Prime music functionalities, it’s working as well as limitations and, in the end, we propose an improved version of the existing system.

# Objectives

When customers use the Amazon Prime Video App, they thought of giving Amazon Prime Music a try (In India, Amazon has only prime music service). Though they liked the app in terms of quality of songs, however, they felt that the interface could be more seamless and intuitive. Users faced difficulty in accessing features, also found that some basic and essential app features are missing. Hence, we took it as an opportunity to polish the experience and redesign the prime music app around these objectives:

•	Revamp the UI and UX

•	Add new features and functionality

•	Catering to different roles


# Review
The proposed design managed to overcome almost all of the limitations we identified from the app and received above 70% of positive responses from different categories of user. The prototype is designed successfully by following Norman’s 7 principles of usability.
